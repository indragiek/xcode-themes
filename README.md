## xcode-theme

Color themes for Xcode 4 and 5. Install to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes` and restart Xcode. The font I use is [Meslo LG DZ](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font) 12pt.

### Themes

#### Dull Dark

Dark theme with bright but heavily desaturated colors. Good for working at night without blinding colors all up in your face.
